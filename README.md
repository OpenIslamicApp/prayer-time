# Prayer Time Calendar(previously Ramadan Calendar)

This project had started as a static Ramadan Calendar for Ramadan 2022 for Dhaka, Bangladesh (GMT+6) and only in the Bangla language.
But now it has more almost all months in Dhaka Bangladesh (GMT+6) Times. And will start adding more areas of Bangladesh soon.

So feel free to contribute along the way. And add your time zone.
